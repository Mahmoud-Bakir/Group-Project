      <p>Recently, AI has come up in discussion with a client or a colleague a few times, and I have noticed a misconception in people's perceptions of the technology. Many people seem to have the impression that this occurrence will mostly likely have significant effects on the computer industry.

        In case you had not observed, today's society revolves around technology. Remember when economist Paul Krugman said, "By 2005 or so, it will become obvious that the Internet's effect on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's?" in 1998?

      <p>Many company executives are concerned about cybersecurity, particularly in light of the rise in cybersecurity breaches expected in 2020. 
        Hackers took advantage of people working from home, less secure technical systems,
         and Wi-Fi networks to increase attacks by 600% during the epidemic. AI and machine learning will be essential instruments for recognizing and anticipating cybersecurity dangers.
          Given that it can handle massive quantities of data to anticipate and detect fraud,
         AI will also be a vital tool for security in the financial sector.  </p>
